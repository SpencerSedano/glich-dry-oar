      <p>Hey! I'm Spencer, I'm from Lima, Peru. I'm not married, and I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 14 years.</p>

        I enjoy learning about technology. I find it challenging but it amazes me of what I could do learning more about the tech industry.

        When I have free time, I would love to play ping pong because that's my favorite sport, but currently I'm not able to play it because of the pandemic. Therefore, what I usually do is to learn mandarin Chinese. I know it is such a strange hobby, but I like it.
