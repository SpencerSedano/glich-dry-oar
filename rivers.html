            <p class="river-paragraph-1">
                This brand new option introduced by Amazonas Explorer makes an Apurimac rafting experience available to even more people. This gentler section of the Apurimac river takes you down to Cconoc with its thermal springs. <br>
              <br>
              

This section can be run in a raft when the water on other sections is too high. And in lower water,  it is ideal for taking smaller children, who can sit in the raft under the care of an expert Peru rafting guide. Or for those who want to paddle their own boat, it is suitable for confident beginners to take a single or double sit on top kayak, or even a stand-up paddleboard.

            <h2 class="river-headline-2 rivers-headline">Urubamba River</h2>
            <p class="river-paragraph-2">
While somehow still the most popular section of river for white water rafting in Peru, due to its location in the Sacred Valley, we do not recommend Urubamba River Rafting for health and safety reasons and we refuse to operate it. This section of the Urubamba River is heavily polluted due to the towns and villages of the Sacred Valley emptying waste and black water directly into the river. The rapids on the Urubamba River rafting trip are also nowhere near as good as on the Vilcanota River rafting, let alone the Apurimac River.
              <br>
              <br>

This really is a case of local operators not being honest with their clients. Yes, it fits nicely into an itinerary and as it only takes half a day it makes for a cheaper trip, but that is not an acceptable reason to allow paying clients and the rafting guides employed to take them to endanger their health by coming into contact with such polluted water.
